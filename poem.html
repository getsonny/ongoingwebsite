    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? </p>
    <P>Are you - Nobody - Too? </p>
    <p>Then there's a pair of us!</p>
    <p>Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
        <br>
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody! </p>
    <p>How public - like a Frog - </p>
    <p>To tell one's name - the livelong June - </p>
    <p>To an admiring Bog!</p>
